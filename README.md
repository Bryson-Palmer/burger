  Welcome to `BJJ's Burgers!` This is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu themed burger app/restaraunt. Tap out your hunger with the classic Americana. Or go big with Tripple Flying Triangle. At BJJ's Burgers we grapple with only the freshest ingredients. All you have to do is `bump`, `slap`, and `tap` that burger. So have fun creating new burgers, clicking through the image carousel to see what tasty submitions have been created already, or any other interactive part of the app. This app was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM (yum!). This app follows an MVC design structure.

  ## üîç <a id='future-development'></a> Future Development
  I don't have any future plans for this app as it was an exercise in setting up an express server, with a MysQL database, utilizing handlebars as the view engine, and a homemade ORM. This app could be used on restaraunt tablets to enhance guest experience. Or a standalone app that could be used for ordering burgers and such.
